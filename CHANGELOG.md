==============================

The format of this changelog is based on the [nf-core](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) changelog.

## [1.0.0] - 2022-07-28

### Updates

- This is the first release of the RNAseq pipeline. During testing everything seems to be running okay aside from a two samples in my test run that keep timing out when computing coverage tracks. This issue will hopefully be resolved in the next release.

### Parameters

Parameters for the first release can be found [here](docs/params.md).
