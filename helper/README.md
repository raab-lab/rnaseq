Helper Scripts
==============

Three helper scripts are provided for easily running each step of the RNASeq pipeline. Here's how you can use them:

1. Download the scripts by clicking the script name above then the "Raw" tab. Then right-click and "Save Page As..." to save the file. Move the file to longleaf and put it in your personal directory.

2. Whenever you are ready to run the pipeline, create an experiment specific directory and copy the scripts over. 

3. Modify the scripts with the necessary parameters and you are ready to run the pipeline!
